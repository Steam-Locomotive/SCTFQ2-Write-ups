CTFs (Capture-the-Flag) are competitions where contestants must solve a series of challenges, each of which contains a flag (typically a hidden string of text). The challenges range from web exploits to reverse engineering to cryptography. sCTF is one such competition created by sCTF, an organization dedicated to creating and running CTF problems.

We are Steam Locomotive, a team of high school students from the [Liberal Arts and Science Academy in Austin, TX](http://www.lasahighschool.org/). We are:
* Ehsan Asdar - [Oksisane](https://github.com/oksisane)
* Michael Barre - [meeees](https://github.com/meeees)
* Ashwin Gupta - [Shwinn](https://github.com/Shwinn)
* Neil Patil - [patil215](https://github.com/patil215)
* John - [Jumboperson](https://github.com/jumboperson)
* Jonathan S

During sCTF, we accumulated a total of 3030 points and finished in 1st place.

Our goal is to maintain a comprehensive set of write-ups for all the challenges within sCTF. It is a work in progress, so if we haven't posted a writeup  yet, don't worry! All will be added in the coming weeks.

If you found these write-ups helpful, be sure to star the repository on [Github](https://github.com/Steam-Locomotive/SCTFQ2-Write-ups/)!
